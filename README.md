**WIFI SCANNER**

The proposed project Wi-Fi Scanner detects Wi-Fi signals in the immediate surrounding and displays necessary information about them such as Network Name, MAC Address, Maximum Speed, etc.
Using Scan Method, will scan the wireless networks available nearby and display some features including its mac address, security, channel, signal strength, encryption type, radio type, basic rates, network type related to each available network. The idea behind the proposed project Wi-Fi Scanner is to provide ease to Wi-Fi users. Though the Wi-Fi Scanner is helpful for normal access clients who need to discover the signal quality distribution for their wireless or remote network at home or select a position for their access point for ideal sign quality. 
Utilizing Wi-Fi Scanner, you can assess the distribution of wireless networks by channel and select the least congested bandwidth for their access point, allowing them to increase their connection speed significantly.
